This is an app for a school project, displaying the buoyancy of objects in a liquid.
To run this code you first must:

1. Download the files "Buoyency application" and "calculations"
2. Click Run "Buoyency application" 
3. Once you have clicked Run, you then slide the sliders using mouse to whatever value you want.
4. After you have done 3, you click Import which will import this data into the variables that have been setup (kinda)
5. You have completed all you must do, you now have the ability to feast your eayes upon the graphically incredible simulation of something close enough to a square reacts when its heavier, lighter or the same density as water!
