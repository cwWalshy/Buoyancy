# Buoyancy

This is an app for a small 1 week project, displaying the buoyancy of an object in water.
To run this code you first must:

1. Download the files "Buoyency application" and "calculations"
2. In command line "Python Buoyancy application.py" to run the program. (note for this to work properly you must have pygame)
3. Once you have clicked Run, you then slide the sliders using mouse to whatever value you want.
4. After you have done 3, you click Import which will import this data into the variables that have been setup (kinda)
5. You have completed all you must do, you now have the ability to feast your eayes upon the graphically incredible simulation of how something close enough to a square reacts when its heavier, lighter or the same density as water!
